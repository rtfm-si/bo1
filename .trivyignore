# GHSA-58pv-8j8x-9vj2: jaraco.context path traversal vulnerability
# This is vendored inside setuptools and not directly exploitable in our app.
# setuptools 80.9.0 still bundles jaraco.context 5.3.0 internally.
# We don't use jaraco.context directly - it's only used by setuptools internals.
# Tracked: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues - waiting for upstream fix
