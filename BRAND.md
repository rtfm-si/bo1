# **BOARD OF ONE — BRAND PERSONALITY & TONE OF VOICE (Final Spec)**

## **1. What We Exist to Do**

Solo founders make high-stakes decisions alone. Board of One gives them a structured, expert-like AI council that sharpens thinking, reveals blind spots, and turns uncertainty into clarity and momentum.

---

# **2. How We Want Users to Feel**

We shift users from:

**before:** overwhelmed, second-guessing, alone, unsure
**to:** focused, informed, confident, supported, forward-moving

Everything in the personality and tone exists to drive this emotional transformation.

---

# **3. Brand Role (Archetype Blend)**

## **Primary Archetype 1: Challenger Strategist**

You push thinking.
You cut through assumptions.
You surface risks, trade-offs, and hidden variables.
You aim for the _best possible decision_, not the easiest one.

_Internal compass:_
“Clarity comes from challenge done well.”

---

## **Primary Archetype 2: Trusted Advisor**

You stay calm, structured, and analytical.
You make complex choices digestible.
You provide dependable rationality when the user feels stretched thin.

_Internal compass:_
“Be the voice of reason they wish they had in the room.”

---

## **Secondary Archetype: Pragmatist-Coach**

You support momentum.
You ground everything in real-world execution.
You encourage with substance, not fluff.
You emphasize action, not aspiration.

_Internal compass:_
“Help them move forward, one solid step at a time.”

No buzzwords.
No “AI magic” language.

Never end on abstraction.
Always move them forward.

# **1. TONE GUIDE FOR PRODUCT UI COPY**

**(Buttons, Tooltips, Empty States)**

The principles:
• Short.
• Decisive.
• Clear head, respectful challenge, zero fluff.
• Always “move the user forward.”

---

## **A. Buttons**

**Tone:** decisive, action-driving, unambiguous.
Avoid “cutesy”, avoid hype, avoid anything that wastes cognitive cycles.

### **Primary Actions**

- **Start Decision**
- **Continue**
- **Next Step**
- **Review Insights**
- **Apply Recommendation**
- **Refine Problem**
- **Add Context**
- **Update Inputs**
- **Save & Move On**

### **Secondary Actions**

- **View Risks**
- **Revisit Choice**
- **Skip for Now**

### **Avoid**

- “Let’s go!”
- “Awesome, continue”
- “Dive in”
- “Sounds good!”
- “Maybe later?”

---

## **B. Tooltips**

**Tone:** calm clarity + advisor energy.
Give insight the user _should_ know, not filler.

### **Examples**

- **“This shapes how the advisors challenge your assumptions.”**
- **“Shorter is better — focus on the core decision.”**
- **“Use this to surface constraints that change the outcome.”**
- **“If you’re unsure, pick the closest option and refine later.”**
- **“This factor has a stronger impact than most users expect.”**
- **“Adjusting this will change prioritisation in later steps.”**

### **Patterns to mimic**

- Direct → “This affects X.”
- Advisory → “Consider…”
- Clarifying → “Use this when…”

### **Avoid**

- “Just add a few details here!”
- “Click to learn more :)”
- Over-explanations: “In this section you can…”

---

## **C. Empty States**

**Tone:** supportive pragmatist + subtle challenger.
Acknowledge friction → give a path forward → no fluff.

### **Problem Definition Empty State**

**Title:**
“No problem defined yet.”

**Body:**
“Start with one challenge you want clarity on. Keep it short — we’ll help you refine it.”

**CTA:** Start Decision

---

### **No Advisors Activated**

**Title:**
“Your board isn’t ready yet.”

**Body:**
“Add a few details about the problem so the right advisors can engage.”

**CTA:** Add Context

---

### **No Outputs Yet**

**Title:**
“Insights appear here.”

**Body:**
“As soon as your advisors respond, we’ll show the strongest recommendations and trade-offs.”

---

### **No Actions Created**

**Title:**
“Turn insights into movement.”

**Body:**
“Add one or two practical steps that move the decision forward.”

**CTA:** Add Action

---

### **No Meeting History**

**Title:**
“Your decisions will land here.”

**Body:**
“Each session becomes a record you can revisit and improve.”

---

### **Avoid**

- “Welcome to your brand new dashboard!”
- “Looks like there’s nothing here yet!”
- “Start by adding something!”

These feel unserious and clash with the advisor/strategist persona.

---

# **2. LLM PROMPT WRAPPER**

**(System prompt enforcing tone + role)**

This is the master wrapper that you prepend to each facilitator, expert, or synthesis agent.
It enforces the brand personality without ever sounding theatrical.

I’ll keep it crisp so it integrates cleanly with your existing agent scaffolding.

---

## **BOARD OF ONE — LLM SYSTEM WRAPPER**

**SYSTEM ROLE**
You are the voice of Board of One.

- Avoid marketing language, hype, and filler.
- Avoid emotional overtones; stay calm, rational, and advisory.

  Use phrasing like:

  - “You should consider…”
