Here’s the **Hormozi-style playbook specifically for an MVP closed-beta landing page** aimed at **future prospective customers** where the goal is to **show the magic, hide the machinery, and NOT lock into a price yet**.

# **MVP Closed-Beta Hormozi Landing Page Playbook (Magic > Machinery)**

_Purpose: attract early adopters, build desire, communicate transformation, avoid premature detail, avoid pricing lock-in._

---

# **1. Make It Feel Like a Breakthrough, Not a Prototype**

**Rule:** Always communicate the _end-state experience_, not the early-stage roughness.

- “Experience decision-making like you have a full executive board… without hiring anyone.”
- “Your thinking, sharpened. Your decisions, accelerated.”

**DO NOT:**

- mention “MVP,” “still building,” or anything that weakens perceived value
- over-explain the system, personas, LLM orchestration, or architecture

Focus purely on the _effect_.

---

# **2. Show the Magic (Outcome), Hide the Machinery (Tech)**

**Rule:** Copy must emphasise **transformation, clarity, speed, and confidence**, never internal components.

Examples:

- “You bring the question. It brings the clarity.”
- “A complete strategic conversation distilled into one decisive recommendation.”
- “Think faster. Decide smarter.”

No mention of:

- personas
- facilitators
- agents
- vector search
- sub-problems
- RAG
- pipelines

Those stay invisible.

---

# **3. Future-Proof Claims Without Anchoring to Final Pricing**

**Rule:** Position the beta as an exclusive early look at something that will be _significantly more valuable later_.

- “Early access to technology normally reserved for bigger teams.”
- “Locked-in benefits and early influence on the roadmap.”
- “Priority entry when full plans launch.”

**Avoid:**

- explicit pricing
- tiers
- commitments

---

# **4. Stress Exclusivity and Scarcity, but Ground It**

Because this is closed beta:

- “Limited to a small group of founders and solo operators.”
- “We onboard a handful at a time for quality and feedback.”
- “Request an invite — not everyone gets in.”

This feels premium, controlled, and intentional.

---

# **5. Hammer the Dream Outcome**

**Rule:** Be crystal clear about the transformation.

For a B2SB SaaS like Board of One, these are the core dream outcomes:

- **Make confident decisions without second-guessing yourself**
- **Diagnose problems like a seasoned strategist**
- **Save hours of back-and-forth and get to clarity fast**
- **Access a “boardroom” you could never hire**
- **Think better, move faster, reduce wasted effort**

The LLM should _never_ dilute these with long technical explanations.

---

# **6. Quantify the Value Without Pricing**

Use numbers that give weight without anchoring price:

- “Decisions 2–5× faster.”
- “10–50× cheaper than hiring external advisors.”
- “Minutes to clarity, not days.”

Keep everything directional, future-leaning, and benchmark-style — not tied to tiers.

---

# **7. Turbocharge Perceived Likelihood of Success**

Since it’s MVP, credibility matters.

Use:

- testimonials (if available)
- small quotes
- early results
- screenshots of outcomes
- anonymised case snippets
- metrics (“92% found clarity on their first problem”)

But keep them **experience-focused**.
Not engineering-focused.

---

# **8. Remove Nearly All Friction**

**Rule:** The CTA is _not_ “Buy now” — it’s _“Get early access,” “Join the beta,” or “See it in action.”_

A good closed-beta flow looks like:

- CTA: **Request Early Access**
- Secondary CTA: **See an Example Decision** (or “View a sample outcome”)
- After email submission: short onboarding question → waitlist positioning

The LLM should never push commitment.

---

# **9. Use Identity + Status Positioning**

Beta testers must feel like **insiders**, not guinea pigs.

- “Built for operators who want sharper thinking and faster decisions.”
- “For those who want an elite decision process — without elite cost.”
- “Join the group shaping the future of strategic AI.”

This builds _status_, which Hormozi leans on heavily.

---

# **10. No Deep Feature Lists — Only Value Blocks**

Because you're not selling feature parity, you’re selling transformation.

LLM framing should be:

- **Block 1 – Clarity on Demand**
  “Ask a question, get a structured recommendation in minutes.”

- **Block 2 – Multiple Expert Perspectives**
  “You’ll see blind spots you didn’t know you had.”

- **Block 3 – Action You Can Execute Today**
  “Walk away with concrete steps — not abstract insight.”

- **Block 4 – Designed for Real Workflows**
  “Simple, fast, no setup.”

Each block = value → not “facilitator persona” or “balancer agent.”

---

# **11. Use Soft Risk Reversal**

Since it’s not a paid product yet, risk reversal ≠ guarantee.

Instead, use:

- “Cancel anytime.”
- “No obligation.”
- “Your feedback shapes the roadmap.”
- “We open spots based on fit and usage, not payment.”

This makes entry feel “zero-risk, high-reward.”

---

# **12. Avoid Any Hint of DIY Tools**

No comparisons like “better than ChatGPT” at this stage.
Focus on **systemised clarity**, not tools.

Good framing:

- “Not another AI chat — a strategic thinking engine.”
- “A complete decision process, not just an assistant.”

This avoids commoditisation.

---

# **13. CTA-Driven Narrative Flow**

The landing page should feel like:

1. **Promise / outcome**
2. **Why this matters**
3. **What makes this different**
4. **Examples of value**
5. **Social proof / early wins**
6. **Invitation to closed beta**
7. **FAQ that reduces hesitation**
8. **Final CTA**

The LLM must stick to this flow.

---

# **14. Keep Everything Crisp, Sparse, and Modern**

Closed-beta landing pages win by feeling _premium_ and _intentional_.

LLM content rules:

- short sections
- lots of whitespace
- 6–12 word headlines
- 1–2 line subheadlines
- bullets instead of paragraphs
- everything communicates confidence

Avoid over-explaining anything.

---

# **15. Think Like a Founder, Not a Salesperson**

Tone guidelines:

- confident
- matter-of-fact
- not pushy
- not hyped
- subtle exclusivity
- “We’re building something serious — join early if you get it.”

Hormozi method is high-value, not high-pressure.

# **1. SYSTEM PROMPT (LLM PLAYBOOK)**

## **System Prompt: “Hormozi Landing Page Generator – Magic Mode”**

You write landing page copy for a closed-beta B2SB SaaS using the Hormozi value method.
Your rules:

1. **Always prioritise transformation over features.**

   - Lead with clarity, confidence, speed, reduced uncertainty.
   - Never explain internal mechanics (no agents, personas, pipelines, LLMs, RAG, etc.).

2. **Always communicate the magic, never the machinery.**

   - Focus on the experience: “Ask. Understand. Decide.”
   - Outcomes > processes.
   - Avoid technical details unless used as social proof (“breakthrough process,” “structured thinking engine,” etc.).

3. **Use Hormozi’s value levers without referencing them:**

   - Max dream outcome
   - Max perceived likelihood
   - Min time delay
   - Min effort + sacrifice

4. **Keep copy crisp, minimal, premium.**

   - Headlines: 6–12 words
   - Subheaders: 1–2 lines
   - Bullets > paragraphs
   - No fluff.

5. **Position the closed beta as exclusive.**

   - “Limited early access”
   - “Request an invite”
   - “We onboard a handful at a time.”
   - Never use language like “MVP,” “in progress,” “early build,” etc.

6. **Never mention pricing. Ever.**

   - Instead, use soft anchors like:
     _“Full pricing launches later this year. Beta users get locked-in benefits.”_

7. **Identity-driven tone.**

   - The reader is a sharper operator, a clearer thinker, a decisive founder.
   - Sell status through capability.

8. **Objection handling must be subtle and confident.**

   - No defensive tone.
   - Show inevitability.

9. **Never compare directly to GPT or other AI tools.**

   - Instead:
     _“Not another AI chat — a complete strategic thinking engine.”_

10. **End with a high-status invitation.**

    - “Request access”
    - “Join the first cohort”

---

---

# **WHY THIS MATTERS**

### **The toughest part of running a business isn’t the work. It’s the decisions.**

Bad decisions cost time. No decisions cost growth.

**You deserve clarity without hiring a team.**

No back-and-forth. No waiting. No second-guessing.

## **1. Clarity on Demand**

A full strategic breakdown distilled into a decisive recommendation.

## **2. Expert-Level Thinking Without Experts**

See angles you wouldn’t spot alone. Make smarter moves.
It’s like having a boardroom — without the board.

## **3. Fast, Frictionless, Zero Setup**

Open, ask, get clarity.
Minutes, not meetings.

## **4. Action You Can Execute Today**

Leave with concrete next steps — not vague insight.

---

# **MICRO BEFORE → AFTER SNIPPET**

### **Before**

Uncertain, circling, second-guessing, reading too much, asking the wrong questions.

### **After**

A crisp recommendation, a breakdown of why it works, and a roadmap for your next move.

---
