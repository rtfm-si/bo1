COMPREHENSIVE LANDING PAGE IMPROVEMENTS

CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix First)

1. "You bring the question. We bring the clarity" Section

PROBLEM: The 4 centered paragraphs feel flat, wall-of-text-like, not engaging or dynamic.

RECOMMENDATION: Replace with a clean "How It Works" 3-step process:

1. Ask Your Question → (icon) → Describe your decision in plain language
2. Get Expert Analysis → (icon) → 3-5 expert perspectives surface blind spots and trade-offs
3. Take Action → (icon) → Walk away with a clear recommendation and next steps

WHY:

- More structured (aligns with BRAND.md "use structure")
- Shows the process visually (more engaging)
- "Lead with the point" - tells them exactly what happens
- Feels professional, not fluffy
- Reduces cognitive load

---

2. "How We're Different" Section + 3 Feature Cards

PROBLEM: Too abstract. Telling instead of showing. Redundant with other sections.

RECOMMENDATION: Replace with concrete proof:

- Option A: Show a real decision output screenshot (blurred sensitive details) with annotations
- Option B: Add a 2-sentence case study snippet: "Founder choosing between 2 growth strategies. Board of One
  identified 3 blind spots. Decision made in 12 minutes. Saved $40K."
- Option C: Remove this section entirely and merge the 3 cards into social proof or testimonials

WHY:

- HORMOZI.md: "Show the magic, hide the machinery"
- Concrete > Abstract
- Builds trust through proof, not claims

---

3. "Early Access" Section - Colored Box

PROBLEM: The teal/accent gradient box feels salesy and dated.

RECOMMENDATION: Remove the colored background box. Keep the benefits list but style it cleanly:

- White/neutral background with subtle border
- Cleaner typography
- Less "look at me" vibes
- More "matter-of-fact" advisor tone

WHY:

- BRAND.md: "No hype"
- Looks more professional and trustworthy
- Premium products don't need loud backgrounds

---

MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS (High Impact)

4. Reduce Section Redundancy

PROBLEM: Multiple sections say similar things (clarity, expert thinking, fast, etc.)

RECOMMENDATION: Consolidate:

- Merge "Complete breakdown / Multiple perspectives / Real-world recommendations" cards into the 4 value blocks
- Result: Go from 4 value blocks → 3 stronger, more comprehensive value blocks:
  a. Expert-Level Analysis (combines "Expert thinking" + "Complete breakdown" + "Multiple perspectives")
  b. Clear Recommendations (combines "Clarity on Demand" + "Real-world recommendations")
  c. Ongoing Support (keeps "Accountability Built In" + adds "Fast and Frictionless")

WHY:

- Less repetition
- Each section carries more weight
- Cleaner page flow
- BRAND.md: "No fluff"

---

5. Add Social Proof / Trust Signals

PROBLEM: No evidence that real people use this and get results.

RECOMMENDATION: Add a lightweight social proof section after "From Fog to Focus":

- 2-3 short, specific testimonials (can be anonymized)
- Focus on outcomes: "Saved 3 days of research", "Caught a risk I totally missed", "Made my first confident pricing
  decision"
- Style: minimal, text-only, no photos needed
- Alternative: "Used by founders at [industry types]" if you don't have testimonials yet

WHY:

- HORMOZI.md: "Max perceived likelihood of success"
- Builds trust through specificity
- Shows it's not vaporware

---

6. Decision Types Carousel - Reposition

PROBLEM: Buried at the bottom, feels disconnected.

RECOMMENDATION: Move it directly after the "Why This Matters" section

- Make it a subheading under that section
- Or turn it into the transition between "Why This Matters" and "How It Works"

WHY:

- Better flow: Problem → Applicable use cases → Solution
- Reinforces "this is for you" message earlier

---

POLISH IMPROVEMENTS (Nice to Have)

7. Value Blocks - Add Subtle Interactivity

RECOMMENDATION: On hover, show a 1-sentence concrete example beneath each:

- Expert-Level Analysis → "Example: Identified cap table dilution risk you hadn't considered"
- Clear Recommendations → "Example: Hire first, spend 30% on ads later"
- Ongoing Support → "Example: Track 3 KPIs, adjust pricing in Q2"

WHY:

- Makes value blocks more concrete
- Shows magic, not machinery
- More engaging and dynamic

---

8. Hero Section - Metrics Band

RECOMMENDATION: Consider adding one more metric for symmetry (makes 4 → 5):

- "1 Question" - "One problem at a time"

ALTERNATIVE: Keep 4 but adjust to 2x2 grid on tablet instead of 4 columns

WHY:

- Better responsive layout
- Cleaner visual balance

---

9. FAQ Section - Reorder Questions

RECOMMENDATION: Lead with the most important questions first:

1. "What kind of decisions does Board of One help with?" (move to top)
2. "Is Board of One another AI chat tool?"
3. "How does it work?" (add this)
4. Rest of the questions

WHY:

- Prioritizes most common questions
- Reduces friction
- HORMOZI.md: "Remove nearly all friction"

---

10. Add "See It In Action" Section (Optional)

RECOMMENDATION: After "How It Works", add a lightweight "See a Sample Session" section:

- Screenshot or simple illustration of the interface
- OR embed a 30-second screen recording walkthrough (when available)
- Keep it simple and tasteful

WHY:

- Shows > Tells
- Reduces uncertainty
- Makes it feel real and tangible

---

COPY IMPROVEMENTS

11. Tighten Language Throughout

Examples:

- "Built for operators who want sharper thinking and faster decisions" → "For operators who need clarity, fast."
- "Rolling invites throughout Q4 2025. We'll notify you when ready." → "Invites sent weekly. First-come,
  first-served."
- "Track actions, get follow-up support. Plan B when things don't pan out." → "Track progress. Adjust when plans
  change."

WHY:

- BRAND.md: "Direct", "No waffle"
- Shorter = punchier = more confident

---
