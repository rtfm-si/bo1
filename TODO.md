feature request
implement some kind of 'gated' features, where (user a) can see page 123 but user b cant

# Activate the venv

source .venv/bin/activate

ssh root@139.59.201.65

db tests users etc

add business context page
& research competition

new meeting
(suggest q's based on bus context - CTA to add)

'please wait' message ui is inconsistent

dont need to display' discussion_quality_status' events in the main meeting ui in left panel

meetings seem to disappear from the dashboard - why?

some kind of 'simple' kanban board for actions

'mentor mode' - speak with an expert directly in a chat (like chatgpt) but has business and problem context and actions etc etc

full report:
rounds, minutes, experts = replace with experts and why?
full synthesis missing
needs the exec summary and recommendation right after problem statement

opus:
look for legacy / backwards compatibility / fallback and simplify, we dont need this - no live customers
look for persistence gaps - we should be storing all outputs we produce for end users (meetings etc) in the db
look for optimisations, efficiencies - redundant conversions between pydantic and dicts etc. or simplify this via an reuseable 'autoconverter'?
look for libraries and depedencies providing the same / conflicting capability
look for front end and back end issues

need a counter for:
topics explored
research performed
risks mitigated
challenges resolved
etc...

inject business context

add delete user to admin
add 'lock accohnt' to admin
