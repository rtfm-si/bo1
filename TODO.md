# Activate the venv

source .venv/bin/activate

ssh root@139.59.201.65

db tests users etc

left panel:
research needed needs 'hidden' in ui, but acknowledged / referenced by expert?

we only seem to have 1 expert per round - is that right? should we allow each expert to speak if they have something to add? we have much better logic for tracking agreement and consensus etc now. we might find stronger / faster convergence if we allow all experts to contribute in parallel after each session, based on everythning they have seen to date.

each expert contribution needs better formatted text (bullets? 2 line summary?)

actions should have a bit of detail next to them, beyond just the title

right panel:

expert contributions in rows PER sub problem (and overall) in columns ?

add business context page
& research competition
