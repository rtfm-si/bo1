# Plan: Backlog Review - No Actionable Tasks

## Summary

- All P0-P2 tasks completed
- Remaining items are P4 (deferred), blocked, or require user input
- No implementation work available without unblocking decisions

## Current Backlog Status

### Blocked/Requires User Decision
- [LAUNCH][P1] Switch Stripe to live mode - **manual action**
- [LAUNCH][P1] Test emergency access procedures - **manual action**
- [BILLING][P4] Configure Stripe products/prices - **manual action**
- [EMAIL][P4] Payment receipt email - blocked on Stripe
- [SOCIAL][P3] Direct posting - blocked on user decision
- [MONITORING][P1] K8s manifest - **needs clarification**
- [DATA][P2] Soft-delete behavior - **needs clarification**

### Low Priority / Deferred
- [RESEARCH][P4] Cross-user research sharing - requires privacy review
- [FUTURE][P4] Peer benchmarking - deferred by design

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Unblock Stripe** (user action): Switch to live mode, configure products/prices
2. **Clarify K8s** (user decision): Are we using Kubernetes?
3. **Clarify soft-delete** (user decision): Confirm retention vs hard-delete behavior
4. **Test procedures** (user action): Run emergency access test

## No Implementation Plan Generated

No coding tasks available. Awaiting:
- User decisions on blocked items
- Clarification on ambiguous requirements
- New feature requests
