click and drag on gantt clicks into action. only click and release should click in, click and drag should not.
are the dates persisted on drag?
actions / meetings should be able top be assigned to projects, with dependencies
actions added to report should show the full detail of the actions
clicking back on action should take you back to kanban / gantt - whatveer was previous
can / should we better colour code the gantt chart? projects/ status
can we track delays and early start / finish etc?
can / should we have some way to measure proress on actions? percent, or points, or status? action states need expanding
test suites seem to take a LONG time - how can we better optimise them?
