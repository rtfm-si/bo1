update to sico software ltd as 'company'

context and sub pages fill WHOLE screen - should have a order similar to other pages
as does reports> competitors / benchmarks
reports > meetings should be for completed meeting reports
reports > competitors needs more detail

actions kanban drag and drop between states (columns) doesnt work
more states (user defined?)

action in progress > todo shows error
changing action states is currently one way - should allow state change, but only for say ~1 day/hour? tell user
action schedule and dates isnt well organised - looks scrappy
action steps to complete - should have a 'trigger mentor button 'halp' - how do incomplete this?'
actions should also be able to be replanned / closed as 'failed' or something

projects cards ui is wrong - text appears outside card

projests > generate projects results in errors

settingds > onboard tour (driver.js) > if you click away from intended flow, it highlights wrong page areas
we should extend this for other pages (actions, projects)

I want some kind of visual that shows the relationship between :
meetings -< actions
meetings -< projects
projects -< actions
that we can include in onboarding, or help pages?

help pages need a bit of work (todo for Si)

workspace - we should create a workspace for every account, can add other users to a workspace. no users with no workspace

all admin pages need fixing
extended kpi's = unextepcted error
active sessions = 404
usage metrics = unknown error
ai ops self healing = unknown error
landing page analytics = unknown error
embeddings = unknown error

auto seo - where did we get to with that and where is it?
