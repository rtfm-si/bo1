we should probably extend the consent tracking to gdpr and anything else we need consent for to provide the service, to ensure we are legally compliant and protected, whilst also making it explicit to end users

we should have a link to the consented terms, gdpr and any other policies in the user settings page. once accepted, should the user be able to revoke - i dont think so? the user can only accept the latest terms and not a previous version. we should show the timestampt they consented. user must agree to latest terms and conditions and all others requireing consent before continuing to use the product.

we should allow the user to submit feedback on completed meetings, actions etc. even as simple as thumbs up / thumbs down? and track the performance over time in admin. maybe expose the latest 10 thumbs down events in admin?

we need to checkall rate limits
