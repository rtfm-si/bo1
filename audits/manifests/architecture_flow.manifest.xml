# Architecture Flow Audit Manifest

<audit_manifest>
  <audit_type>architecture_flow</audit_type>

  <purpose>
    Validate end-to-end data and control flow through the multi-agent deliberation system. Ensure graph execution, state transitions, and persona orchestration align with design intent.
  </purpose>

  <scope>
    - LangGraph node topology and edge definitions
    - State machine transitions (problem → decompose → personas → rounds → synthesis)
    - Inter-service communication patterns (API ↔ Graph ↔ LLM)
    - Event propagation through SSE pipeline
  </scope>

  <constraints>
    - Load only bo1/graph/, bo1/orchestration/, backend/api/event_collector.py
    - Respect CONTEXT_BOUNDARY: no frontend unless explicitly needed
    - Max 4 reasoning steps per finding
    - Diffs only; no full file reproductions
  </constraints>

  <required_inputs>
    - bo1/graph/config.py, bo1/graph/state.py, bo1/graph/nodes/
    - bo1/orchestration/persona_executor.py, bo1/orchestration/voting.py
    - backend/api/event_collector.py, backend/api/streaming.py
  </required_inputs>

  <expected_outputs>
    - Flow diagram description (text-based)
    - List of state transitions with validation status
    - Identified bottlenecks or circular dependencies
    - Recommendations (max 5 bullets)
  </expected_outputs>

  <activation_conditions>
    - Before major graph refactors
    - After adding new graph nodes
    - Quarterly architecture review
  </activation_conditions>

  <run_pattern>
    1. Read graph config and state definitions
    2. Trace node execution order
    3. Validate state transitions match expected flow
    4. Check event propagation paths
    5. Output report to /audits/reports/architecture_flow.report.md
  </run_pattern>
</audit_manifest>
