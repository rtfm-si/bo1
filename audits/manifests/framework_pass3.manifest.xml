# Framework Pass 3 - Hardening Manifest

<audit_manifest>
  <audit_type>framework_pass3</audit_type>

  <purpose>
    Strict third-pass hardening: safety, determinism, governance drift protection, architectural integrity, multi-agent correctness, token control.
  </purpose>

  <scope>
    - Lock governance files against drift
    - Harden multi-agent and meeting logic
    - Harden manifests and folder-level CLAUDE files
    - Harden tag system consistency
    - Harden token control and model behaviour
  </scope>

  <constraints>
    - Do NOT regenerate from scratch
    - Only HARDEN, SECURE, LOCK DOWN
    - Keep additions short, atomic, operational
    - Add explicit prohibition rules
  </constraints>

  <required_inputs>
    - All governance files from Pass 2
    - Agent/judge/meeting orchestration files
    - TAGS.md
    - MODEL_GUIDANCE.md
  </required_inputs>

  <expected_outputs>
    - Header rules prohibiting self-modification
    - Deterministic conflict resolution rules
    - Multi-agent correctness rules
    - Token caps and model selection guards
    - Short diffs only
  </expected_outputs>

  <activation_conditions>
    - After Pass 2 completion
    - Security review requirement
  </activation_conditions>

  <run_pattern>
    1. Add governance lock headers
    2. Add multi-agent safety rules
    3. Add domain boundary constraints
    4. Harden tag loading rules
    5. Add token caps
    6. Output minimal changes
  </run_pattern>
