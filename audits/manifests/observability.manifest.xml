# Observability Audit Manifest

<audit_manifest>
  <audit_type>observability</audit_type>

  <purpose>
    Assess logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting coverage. Ensure production issues can be diagnosed from available telemetry.
  </purpose>

  <scope>
    - Structured logging patterns and levels
    - Error handling and exception propagation
    - Health check endpoints
    - Cost and usage tracking
    - Event stream observability
  </scope>

  <constraints>
    - Focus on observability gaps, not implementation details
    - Do not expose sensitive data patterns
    - Respect GOVERNANCE security constraints
    - Audit configuration, not runtime behavior
  </constraints>

  <required_inputs>
    - backend/api/health.py
    - bo1/llm/cost_tracker.py
    - backend/api/event_collector.py
    - Logging configuration in backend/api/main.py
    - Any monitoring config files
  </required_inputs>

  <expected_outputs>
    - Logging coverage map (which components log what)
    - Missing observability points
    - Health check completeness assessment
    - Alert threshold recommendations
    - Tracing correlation ID coverage
  </expected_outputs>

  <activation_conditions>
    - Before production deployment
    - After adding new services/components
    - When debugging production issues is difficult
    - Quarterly observability review
  </activation_conditions>

  <run_pattern>
    1. Inventory logging statements by component
    2. Check health endpoint coverage
    3. Verify error propagation includes context
    4. Assess cost tracking completeness
    5. Output report to /audits/reports/observability.report.md
  </run_pattern>
</audit_manifest>
