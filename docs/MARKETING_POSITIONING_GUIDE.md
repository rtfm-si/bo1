## Support Response Templates

### "How does this work?"

**Template**:
```
Great question! Board of One uses a proprietary deliberation model inspired by decision science research.

Instead of giving you one quick answer (like ChatGPT), we simulate a structured expert panel discussion—surfacing diverse perspectives, identifying tensions and trade-offs, then synthesizing a balanced recommendation.

Think of it like convening a board meeting with expert advisors across finance, marketing, strategy, operations, etc.—all in 5-15 minutes.

The result? Clearer thinking, blind spots surfaced, and higher confidence in your decision.

### "Is this AI-generated?"

**Template**:
```
Yes—Board of One is powered by cutting-edge AI, but it's not "just AI" in the way most tools are.

We use a research-backed deliberation framework that simulates how real expert panels work: diverse viewpoints, structured debate, synthesis. The AI enables this at scale and speed, but the methodology is grounded in decision science.

All outputs include a disclaimer that they're for learning/knowledge purposes only (not professional advisory). We encourage you to validate recommendations with licensed professionals in your jurisdiction.

Questions? Reply anytime—happy to clarify!
```

### "Can I see the AI prompts?"

**Template**:
```
The specific prompts and deliberation mechanics are proprietary (they're part of what makes Board of One unique!), but I can share our design principles:

1. Multiple expert perspectives (finance, marketing, strategy, etc.)
2. Structured deliberation process (not one-shot answers)
3. Trade-off analysis and risk identification
4. Synthesis that balances competing viewpoints

If you're curious about the output, I'd recommend starting a free deliberation—you'll see exactly how the system works from a user perspective: [link]

Happy to answer other questions!
