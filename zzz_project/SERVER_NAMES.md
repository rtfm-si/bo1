Particle Physics (Fundamental Forces)

The building blocks that make reality work

1. quark - Primary production (fundamental particle, indivisible core)
2. boson - Database (force carrier, mediates interactions)
3. hadron - Workers (composite particle, does the heavy lifting)
4. muon - Staging/dev (heavier electron, unstable/testing state)
5. photon - Monitoring/backup (light, observes without touching)
