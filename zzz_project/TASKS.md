  3. [ ] Growth channel prioritization (SEO vs ads vs partnerships)
  4. [ ] Technical debt vs feature development
  5. [ ] Niche pivot (law firms vs agencies vs horizontal)
  6. [ ] Co-founder vs solo decision
  7. [ ] Simple decision (binary choice)
  8. [ ] Complex decision (multiple sub-problems)
  9. [ ] High-conflict scenario (polarized opinions)
  10. [ ] Quick consensus scenario (clear winner)
- [ ] Measure for each:
  - [ ] Time to completion (target: 5-15 min)
  - [ ] Total cost (target: $0.10-0.15)
  - [ ] Number of rounds (should vary by complexity)
  - [ ] Recommendation quality (manual review: actionable? comprehensive?)

#### Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Atomic problem (no decomposition needed)
  - [ ] Single sub-problem = original problem
  - [ ] Deliberation proceeds normally
- [ ] Very complex problem (5 sub-problems)
  - [ ] All sub-problems get deliberated
  - [ ] Final synthesis integrates all recommendations
- [ ] Deadlock scenario (high conflict, no convergence)
  - [ ] Hits max_rounds limit
  - [ ] Facilitator synthesizes despite disagreement
  - [ ] Report includes dissenting views
- [ ] API failures
  - [ ] Retry logic works (3 retries with exponential backoff)
  - [ ] Graceful error messages to user
- [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Backoff strategy works
  - [ ] Deliberation resumes after rate limit clears

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid persona code selected
  - [ ] Validation catches it
  - [ ] Clear error message
- [ ] Redis unavailable
  - [ ] Fallback to in-memory state
  - [ ] Warning logged, deliberation continues
- [ ] Anthropic API key invalid
  - [ ] Clear error message at startup
  - [ ] Prevent execution until fixed
- [ ] Malformed LLM response
  - [ ] Parsing handles gracefully
  - [ ] Retry with adjusted prompt
- [ ] Context length exceeded
  - [ ] Summarization should prevent this
  - [ ] If it happens: force summarization, continue

**Output**: ✅ Robust system with good test coverage

## Success Criteria Checklist

### Functional Requirements (End of Day 28)
- [ ] ✅ Can run end-to-end deliberation (problem → recommendation)
- [ ] ✅ Cost: $0.10-0.15 per sub-problem (within target)
- [ ] ✅ Time: 5-15 min per deliberation
- [ ] ✅ Quality: Actionable recommendations (manual review of 10 samples passing)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] ✅ Prompt caching working (60-70% cost reduction)
- [ ] ✅ Hierarchical context (linear growth, not quadratic)
- [ ] ✅ Convergence detection (early stopping functional)
- [ ] ✅ Problem drift detection (relevance monitoring active)
- [ ] ✅ Adaptive round limits (complexity-based)

### Deliverables

- [ ] ✅ 10+ test scenarios passing
- [ ] ✅ Cost/quality metrics for each deliberation
- [ ] ✅ Documentation (README, architecture, API)
- [ ] ✅ v2 roadmap documented

## Value Delivery Milestones

| Day | Milestone | Demo-able? | Tasks Complete | Value |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| **7** | Foundation ready | ✅ | 56/56 | Enable all future work |
| **14** | End-to-end MVP | ✅ | 77/77 | **Can demo to users** |
| **21** | Cost-optimized | ✅ | 96/96 | 70% cost reduction |
| **28** | Production-ready | ✅ | 114/114 | **Ready to ship** |

## Notes

- Update progress daily by checking off completed tasks
- If blocked on a task, document why and move to next task
- Re-prioritize if needed (optimization can be deferred if quality is at risk)
- Week 2 (Day 14) is critical milestone - focus on getting MVP working
- Cost optimization (Week 3) provides huge value but is not required for demo
- Quality improvements (Week 4) are polish - can continue beyond Day 28
