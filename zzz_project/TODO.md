Prompt: “Design Modern Web App UI From Existing Python Codebase”

SYSTEM / HIGH-LEVEL GOAL
You are a senior product designer and full-stack engineer. Your task is to design a complete, modern, user-focused web app UI based on the existing Python codebase and its domain logic. Prioritise clarity, speed, and UX best practices.

WHAT YOU MUST DO

Analyse the existing Python codebase (routes, models, services, domain logic) to understand:

the core entities

the user flows

the system actions

the implicit UX requirements

Infer the natural UI structure that the backend implies.

Design a modern, intuitive, minimal-friction UI using current best practices (2025).

Output a complete UI plan, including:

Information architecture

Page hierarchy

Key components

Navigation structure

Interaction patterns

Responsive layout approach

Accessibility considerations

Visual system guidelines (spacing, typography, components)

Provide example screens or wireframes (ASCII or structural description).

Keep the design implementation-ready for SvelteKit/React/WeWeb or similar.

REQUIRED DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Declutter aggressively; show only what the user needs at each step.

Prioritise speed: minimal clicks, progressive disclosure, strong defaults.

Use modern patterns: cards, drawers, bottom sheets, sticky context bars, context panels.

Provide system-level clarity: empty states, error states, loading states.

Maintain accessibility: WCAG AA, keyboard navigation, semantic structure.

Use consistent component vocabulary and spacing scale.

INPUT YOU’LL RECEIVE

I will provide:

Use Bo1 codebase and entire modules

@/zzz_project/PRD:
Explanation of the product vision

Key user stories or workflows (if not obvious from code)

OUTPUT FORMAT

High-level UX summary

Information Architecture map

Full Page/Screen list

Component catalogue (design-ready)

Interaction model (flows)

Wireframes

Be concrete, practical, and challenge the existing design assumptions if a superior UX pattern exists.
